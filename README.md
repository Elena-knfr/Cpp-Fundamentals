# ECE244
A second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering course covering the fundamentals of object oriented programming in C++

# Lab 1
The first lab helped us to learn some Unix commands and required us to fix run-time bugs of given codes.

# Lab 2: A Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This lab required us to use classes, objects, and methods by building a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

# Lab 3: A Command Line Parser
In this lab, we used C++ I/O streams including error handling to create a robust parser to interpret user input.

# Lab 4: Linked Lists
In this lab, we were asked to create and manipulate linkedlists.  In the process,  the assignment re-enforces earlier concepts of writing classes with constructors and the destructor. It also serves as an exercise on dynamic allocation and de-allocation of data without memory leaks. 

# Lab 5: Inheritance/Graphics
Finally lab 6 focused on inheritance and required us to write classes inheriting from a simple graphics framework (easyGL). We created a breadboard that allowed users to click, drag, and modify shapes on a screen.

Note to future ECE244 students: This repo can be useful as exposure to a "different" way of problem solving, but please don't use this in your own work. It's bad practice, unethical, and means you won't learn.

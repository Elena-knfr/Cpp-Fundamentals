# ECE244
A second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering course covering the fundamentals of object oriented programming in C++

//# Lab 1
//The first lab helped us to learn some Unix commands and required us to fix run-time bugs of given codes.

//# Lab 2: A Tic-Tac-Toe Game
//This lab required us to use classes, objects, and methods by building a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

# Lab 3: A Command Line Parser
In this lab, we used C++ I/O streams including error handling to create a robust parser to interpret user input.

# Lab 4: Linked Lists
In this lab, we were asked to create and manipulate linkedlists.  In the process,  the assignment re-enforces earlier concepts of writing classes with constructors and the destructor. It also serves as an exercise on dynamic allocation and de-allocation of data without memory leaks. 

# Lab 5: Inheritance and Virtual Functions
Last lab focused on inheritance and required us to write classes inheriting from a base class, called Shape. We then needed to register the command parser call-back functions with the existing shape database and invoke the command parser method of database.
